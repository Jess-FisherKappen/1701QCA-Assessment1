### Experiment 1 - Say Hello to the BBC Micro:bit ###

(The first image shows a smile when the left button is pushed and the second image shows 'hello' when the right button is pushed)

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the basic functions of how the BBC microbit functioms.I had never really done coding or programming before so this was completely new to me. After doing this experiment though I was starting to get a grasp of things. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as simply having a doorbell attached to a screen above it that welcomes you before you enter through the door.

### Experiment 2 - Using a light sensor & analog inputs ###

(The first image shows a sun due to brightness, the second image shows a moon when the phototransitor is in darkness)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how the phototransitor works with light and dark. It was interesting to test out and see that the image on the microbit changes whether light is exposed to it or not. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as having lights that slowly start increasing their brightness as the sun goes down. You could be able to program the settings so only certain lights turn on. 

### Experiment 3 - Dimming an LED using a potentiometer ###

(The first image shows the light on. The second image shows the light is brighter after the potentiometer is turned. The third image shows the light off once the button is pushed)

### Experiment 4 - Using a transistor to driev a motor ###

### Experiment 5 - Using the accelerometer to control motor speed ###


#### Photo of completed project ####

(The first image shows the fan not in motion as the microbit is flat. The second image shows the fan functioning now that the microbit is vertical)
