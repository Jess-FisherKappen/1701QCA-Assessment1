### Experiment 1 - Say Hello to the BBC Micro:bit ###

(The first image shows a smile when the left button is pushed and the second image shows 'hello' when the right button is pushed)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the basic functions of how the BBC microbit functioms.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as simply having a doorbell that welcomes you before you enter through the door.

### Experiment 2 - Using a light sensor & analog inputs ###

(The first image shows a sun due to brightness, the second image shows a moon when the phototransitor is in darkness)

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).

### Experiment 3 - Dimming an LED using a potentiometer ###

(The first image shows the light on. The second image shows the light is brighter after the potentiometer is turned. The third image shows the light off once the button is pushed)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).

### Experiment 4 - Using a transistor to driev a motor ###

### Experiment 5 - Using the accelerometer to control motor speed ###


#### Photo of completed project ####

(The first image shows the fan not in motion as the microbit is flat. The second image shows the fan functioning now that the microbit is vertical)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
